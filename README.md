# Australian Rainfall Prediction

A group project for UBC MDS course DSCI 525 - Web and Cloud Computing.

## Project Description

In this project we will build and deploy ensemble machine learning models in the cloud to predict daily rainfall in Australia with the results presented in the cloud for others to use. The features of our model are the outputs of different climate models, and the target is the actual rainfall observation.

## Dataset
We will be using the "Daily rainfall over NSW, Australia" dataset from [figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681), a large dataset (~6 GB) that contains the output of different climate models and the actual rainfall observed.
